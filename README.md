🩺 Early Disease Diagnosis with AI: Research Project
🔍 Exploring AI in Healthcare for Early Disease Detection

This repository showcases my Fall 2024 research thesis on applying Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, focusing on early disease diagnosis through machine learning and demographic analysis.

📌 Key Highlights
✅ Dual Approach: Combined technical ML modeling (Python, Google Colab) with human-centric survey analysis (Google Forms).
✅ ML Models Applied:

Naïve Bayes Classifier

Random Forest Classifier
✅ Data Processing: Cleaned & analyzed a Kaggle dataset, performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and focused on diagnosis prediction.
✅ Survey Insights: Gathered demographic feedback on AI in healthcare for deeper real-world applicability.

🚀 Why This Project?
Demonstrates AI’s potential in early medical diagnosis

Blends data science + human perspectives for holistic research

Clean, well-documented code & visualizations for reproducibility
